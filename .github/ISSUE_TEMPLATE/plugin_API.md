** Note on comparisons to tmux: Zellij is not, nor does it try to be, a tmux clone. While we appreciate that many people use it as a tmux alternative and are missing their favorite features - this is not what we do here. There are often native alternatives to tmux features that Zellij does differently. We would encourage you to look into those alternatives rather than try to make it work exactly like tmux. A good place to start would be our FAQ: https://zellij.dev/documentation/faq

We believe each program has its strengths and weaknesses, and hope that users would want to use Zellij for what it can do, rather than trying to make it behave like something it does not want to be. Thank you for understanding! **
