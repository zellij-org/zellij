# Contributing to Zellij

Thanks for considering contributing to Zellij!

**First**: if you're unsure of anything, feel free to ask on our [Discord
server](https://discord.gg/MHV3n76PDq), or on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#zellij_general:matrix.org). We're a friendly and welcoming bunch!

# Code of Conduct

Before contributing please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which
all contributors are expected to adhere to.

## Status of Code Contributions (PRs)
At the moment, the Zellij maintainers are very much overloaded implementing our [Roadmap](https://zellij.dev/roadmap) - and so while we very much welcome and appreciate the community's willingness to contribute - we are only able to accept code contributions for larger projects as they appear in said Roadmap.

For those willing to take up such large projects, aside from our enthusiasm - we can offer guidance through issues or our various chat platforms.

If you're still eager to contribute minor fixes, please note that we might take a long while to get to them until the current overload of the project subsides - hopefully in the coming months.

## Building

To build Zellij, we're using cargo xtask. This is a standalone package shipped
inside the repository, so you don't have to install additional dependencies.

To edit our manpage, the mandown crate (`cargo install --locked
mandown`) is used and the work is done on a markdown file in docs/MANPAGE.md.

To build zellij, you'll need [`protoc`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protobuf-compiler-installation) installed. This is used to compile the .proto files into Rust assets. These protocol buffers are used for communication between Zellij and its plugins across the wasm boundary.

Here are some of the commands currently supported by the build system:

```sh
# Format code, build, then run tests and clippy
cargo xtask
# You can also perform these actions individually
cargo xtask format
cargo xtask build
cargo xtask test
# Run Zellij (optionally with additional arguments)
cargo xtask run
cargo xtask run -l strider
# Run Clippy
cargo xtask clippy
# Install Zellij to some directory
cargo xtask install /path/of/zellij/binary
# Publish the zellij and zellij-tile crates
cargo xtask publish
# Update manpage
cargo xtask manpage
```

You can see a list of all commands (with supported arguments) with `cargo xtask
--help`. For convenience, `xtask` may be shortened to `x`: `cargo x build` etc.

To run `test`, you will need the package `pkg-config` and a version of `openssl`.

## Running the end-to-end tests
Zellij includes some end-to-end tests which test the whole application as a black-box from the outside.
These tests work by running a docker container which contains the Zellij binary, connecting to it via ssh, sending some commands and comparing the output received against predefined snapshots.

<details>
<summary>Should you be a macOS (including m1) user, please follow these commands before. (expand here):</summary>

1. `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
2. `brew install messense/macos-cross-toolchains/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
3. `export CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=$(brew --prefix)/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-gcc`
4. `export AR_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=$(brew --prefix)/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-ar`
5. `export CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_MUSL_LINKER=$CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl`
</details>


To run these tests locally, you'll need to have either `docker` or `podman` and also `docker-compose` installed.
Once you do, in the repository root:

1. `docker-compose up -d` will start up the docker container
2. `cargo xtask ci e2e --build` will build the generic linux executable of Zellij in the target folder, which is shared with the container
3. `cargo xtask ci e2e --test` will run the tests

To re-run the tests after you've changed something in the code base, be sure to repeat steps 2 and 3.

## Debugging / Troubleshooting while developing
Zellij uses the excellent [`log`](https://crates.io/crates/log) crate to handle its internal logging. The output of these logs will go to `/$temp_dir/zellij-<UID>/zellij-log/zellij.log` which `$temp_dir` refers to [std::env::temp_dir()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.temp_dir.html). On most of operating systems it points to `/tmp`, but there are exceptions, such as `/var/folders/dr/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx/T/` for Mac.

Example:
```rust
let my_variable = some_function();
log::info!("my variable is: {:?}", my_variable);
```

Note that the output is truncated at 100KB. This can be adjusted for the purposes of debugging through the `LOG_MAX_BYTES` constant, at the time of writing here: https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/blob/main/zellij-utils/src/logging.rs#L24

When running Zellij with the `--debug` flag, Zellij will dump a copy of all bytes received over the pty for each pane in: `/$temp_dir/zellij-<UID>/zellij-log/zellij-<pane_id>.log`. These might be useful when troubleshooting terminal issues.

## Testing plugins
Zellij allows the use of the [Singlepass](https://crates.io/crates/wasmer-compiler-singlepass) compiler for wasmer. This can enable great gains in compilation time of plugins in detriment of stability, notably on Arm64 architectures.

To enable the singlepass compiler, use the `singlepass` flag. E.g.:
```sh
cargo xtask run --singlepass
```

## How we treat clippy lints

We currently use clippy in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/blob/main/.github/workflows/rust.yml) with the default settings that report only [`clippy::correctness`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy#readme) as errors and other lints as warnings because Zellij is still unstable. This means that all warnings can be ignored depending on the situation at that time, even though they are also helpful to keep the code quality.
Since we just cannot afford to manage them, we are always welcome to fix them!

Here is [the detailed discussion](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/1090) if you want to see it.

## Looking for something to work on?

If you are new contributor to `Zellij` going through
[beginners][good-first-issue] should be a good start or you can join our public
[Discord server][discord-invite-link], we would be happy to help finding
something interesting to work on and guide through.

## Tips for Code Contributions

### Prefer returning `Result`s instead of `unwrap`ing

- Add `use zellij_utils::errors::prelude::*;` to the file
- Make the function return `Result<T>`, with an appropriate `T` (Use `()` if there's nothing to return)
- Append `.context()` to any `Result` you get with a sensible error description (see [the docs][error-docs-context])
- Generate ad-hoc errors with `anyhow!(<SOME MESSAGE>)`
- *Further reading*: [See here][error-docs-result]

### Logging errors

- When there's a `Result` type around, use `.non_fatal()` on that instead of `log::error!`
- When there's a `Err` type around, use `Err::<(), _>(err).non_fatal()`
- Also attach context before logging!
- *Further reading*: [See here][error-docs-logging]

### Adding Concrete Errors, Handling Specific Errors

- Add a new variant to `zellij_utils::errors::ZellijError`, if needed
- Use `anyhow::Error::downcast_ref::<ZellijError>()` to recover underlying errors
- *Further reading*: [See here][error-docs-zellijerror]
