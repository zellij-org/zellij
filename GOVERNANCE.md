# Zellij Governance
Zellij is an open source project that belongs to those who contribute to it.
As such, we feel it's important to codify some rules that seem obvious and straightforward now, but might not be in the future.

## Organization members
Members of the Zellij organization are in effect those empowered to make decisions for the project. Individual members are trusted to make decisions on their own and to bring larger and more controversial decisions to be decided by the full quorum of members in a real-time meeting or by correspondence.

## How decisions are made regarding the project
When larger decisions are brought to the full quorum of members, we would like to hear all the voices and dissenting  opinions on the decision at hand. Ideally, we would then decide on a course of action by consensus. Only if one cannot be reached, will each member of the organization get a vote. The decision in the majority will be taken.

In case of ties, one member designated as Arbiter can break the tie. For reasons of focus and expediency, the Arbiter also has veto privileges which are to be used as scarecely as possible.

Some decisions that should always be brought to the quorum of members:
* Adding new members to the organization
* Any decision involving money or finances
* Collaborations with outside organizations

## Role of the Arbiter
The Arbiter is a member of the quorum who serves as a tie breaker in votes and also has veto privileges for the votes themselves. Both of these should be used as seldom as possible and preferably not at all.
Once the organization reaches 10 members, a reasonable and achievable process must be established in order to replace the Arbiter if the need arises (for example: a majority vote of members can replace the Arbiter with another candidate). In any case, the Arbiter has to be an organization member.
